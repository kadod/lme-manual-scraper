Data flow:
1. Fetches single response with relations (friend, form)
2. Verifies ownership through form relationship
3. Renders detailed response view
4. Handles deletion with navigation

## Features Implemented

- Proper column headers from form questions
- UTF-8 encoding for Japanese characters
- Automatic filename generation
- Array answers properly formatted (comma-separated)
- Quote escaping for CSV compatibility

### 4. Statistics & Analytics
- Total response count
- Response rate calculation
- Average completion time (placeholder for future implementation)
- Visual cards with icons

### 5. Response Management
- Individual response deletion
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Ownership verification
- Cascading deletes handled by database

### 6. Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- User authentication checks
- Form ownership verification
- Public form submission allowed for responses
- Protected read/delete operations

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Highlights
```sql
- forms table: id, user_id, title, description, status, fields, settings
- form_responses table: id, form_id, friend_id, line_user_id, response_data, submitted_at
- Indexes on: user_id, form_id, friend_id, line_user_id, submitted_at
- RLS policies for user-scoped data access
- Automatic updated_at timestamps
```

### TypeScript Types
All components use proper TypeScript typing:
- FormResponse interface
- FormStats interface
- Proper null handling
- Type-safe database queries

### Performance Optimizations
1. Parallel data fetching (responses + stats)
2. Database indexes on frequently queried columns
3. Client-side filtering for search (reduces database load)
4. Efficient SQL queries with selective joins

### Accessibility Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Proper heading hierarchy

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Responsive tables
- Collapsible filters on mobile
- Touch-friendly action buttons

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- Supabase database and authentication
- Friends (LINE users) management
- UI component library (shadcn/ui)
- Date formatting with date-fns

### Required Environment Variables
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL (for form URLs)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Pagination for large response sets
2. Bulk operations (delete multiple, bulk export)
3. Response analytics (charts, graphs)
4. Answer validation and scoring
5. Email notifications for new responses
6. Response editing capability
7. Advanced filtering (by question type, answer values)
8. Response comments/notes
9. PDF export option
10. Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test response list with various filter combinations
2. Verify CSV export with Japanese characters
3. Test deletion with ownership verification
4. Check responsive design on mobile devices
5. Validate RLS policies with different users
6. Test empty states (no responses)
7. Verify loading states and error handling
8. Test with large datasets (100+ responses)

## Deployment Notes

1. Run database migration: `20251029_create_forms.sql`
2. Verify Supabase connection and credentials
3. Check RLS policies are active
4. Ensure date-fns Japanese locale is available
5. Verify file download works in production
6. Test CSV encoding in production environment

## Component Dependencies

External packages used:
- @radix-ui/react-* (UI primitives)
- date-fns (date formatting)
- lucide-react (icons - not used, using inline SVG)
- class-variance-authority (button variants)
- tailwind-merge (CSS class merging)

All dependencies are already installed in package.json.
